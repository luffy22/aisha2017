<h3>Hi Isha,</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first invited you to connect on Shaadi.com I had said that I earn in all 
currencies where you wish to go. Well below is the proof: </p>
<div class="mb-1"></div><img src="<?php echo JUri::base(); ?>images/payments_received.png" title="payments received" />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment System was down for maintenance so I did not earn for last six months. I recently 
upgraded the payment system but haven't received any order from offshore customers just yet. But I do have the potential to earn from all currencies 
where you wish to migrate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to go to all countries where you wish to settle. Only difference is I plan to go 
on a <strong>Travel Visa</strong> or <strong>Business Visa</strong>. I don't wish to be their slave on Work Permit or Immigration Visa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have a Masters or MBA cause I did not have time or finance to pursue them due to costly UK Study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know your past but I don't really care about it. I am more interested in spending my future with you. There is a naive place in my heart which wants to know you better and perhaps grow old with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw your Shaadi.com profile I was mesmerized by your honesty and felt a soft corner for you. Then I saw your FB Profile and I started admiring your motivational and thought provoking posts. I totally forgot a popular supermodel was posting them whom I could never, ever match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Bharatmatrimony.com profile says you want no time wasters. I was serious about you since Jan 26 or 27th 2017 when I first saw your profile. I wanted to wait till I earned a good income. But as luck would have it both my website and my payments have declined in last six months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my final attempt to try matrimonial alliance with you. <strong>I honestly wish to heal your heart, to care for you and to be by your side through thick and thin of life</strong>. But I cannot do that without your consent. If your answer is no then I won't harass you anymore. And I would try not to be a <strong>Facebook Pervert</strong> and hurt your feelings on FB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it is a yes then I would try everything in my power to see that you don't have to regret your decision. Whatever your answer I am fine with it. And I wish you all the best for future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. Don't worry no one sees this page apart from me and you. Of course if you show it to others they can see.</p>
